## Relational Operators 

    >   greater than
    <   less than
    >=  greater than or equal to
    <=  less than or equal to
    ==  equal to
    !=  not equal to

Notes:

=   will assign value to a variable
==  will compare values

== and != cannot be used to compare strings. These two operators will compare the memory locations of the strings
and not the values.

## Logical Operators
Used to combine two separate conditions in order to get one boolean value in result

    &&      AND     both conditions must be true
    ||      OR      At least one condition must be true
    !       NOT     condition must be false
