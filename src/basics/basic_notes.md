## Project Structure and Organization

### Packages
Folder or container which holds java files. 
Convention: Packages are named in all lower case. 
Represented by a folder icon with a circle. This file is inside the "basics" package. 

Package naming convention: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html


### Classes 
Convention: Classes are named in camel case. ClassNameExample 


### MD Files (like this one)
they don't seem to like being named with a middle line. 
no-like.md will not show it as an MD file in intellij and therefore will not 
allow to use the "preview" mode.
