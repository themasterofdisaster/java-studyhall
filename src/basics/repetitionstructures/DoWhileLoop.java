    Chapter4b - Do While Loop.

        Add Numbers
        Write a program that allows a user to enter two numbers,
        and then sums up the two numbers. The user should be able to
        repeat this action until they indicate they are done.


    Do While Loop

        do{
            this
        } while(this condition is true)

        Similar to the "while" loop but in this case, the code is executed first and then after that, we check to see
        if the condition is true or not. If it's true, the loop runs once again. If it's false we exit the loop. So
        when using the do while loop the loop will always run at least one time.

public class DoWhileLoop {

    public static void main(String arcs[]){

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        boolean again;

        // The do while loop will run at least one time and THEN it will test the condition to see if it should run again
        do{
            System.out.println("Enter the first number");
            double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();

            System.out.println("Enter the second number");
            double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();

            double sum = num1 + num2;

            System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);

            System.out.println("Would you like to start over? Enter true or false");

            //our sentinel:
            again = scanner.nextBoolean();

        } while(again);

        scanner.close();

    }
